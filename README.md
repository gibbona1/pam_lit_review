# Monitoring with Machines: A review of computational bioacoustics

Ecological monitoring is essential for understanding biodiversity amid rapid global change. Within wildlife monitoring, Passive Acoustic Monitoring has become a powerful and commonplace tool. Advances in computational methods—fuelled by affordable data collection and machine learning—have accelerated its growth, yet challenges persist, particularly in data integration, species coverage, and classification model evaluation. In this paper, we systematically review the state of PAM, analysing approximately 80 studies (2005–2024) spanning diverse taxa and ecosystems. We evaluate its strengths, limitations, and applications.
