    abstract = {Government targets for renewable energy have led to a huge increase in wind farm proposals. Because of its high wind resource, Scotland has more proposed wind farms than any other UK country. Scotland’s upland habitats support many birds of conservation concern, leading to potential conflict with wind farms. To help reduce this conflict, a map of bird sensitivities has been created to guide the location of onshore wind farms in Scotland, based on distributions of 16 bird species of conservation priority and statutory Special Protection Areas. The likely sensitivity of each species to wind farms was assessed from literature, based on foraging ranges, collision risk and sensitivity to disturbance. This information was used to buffer species’ locations to identify areas of ‘high’ or ‘medium’ sensitivity. Individual species maps were converted to 1-km square resolution, and a composite map for all species created by selecting the highest sensitivity rating for each square. The map indicates greater bird sensitivity in northwest Scotland, particularly the Highlands, Western and Northern Isles. Overall, 37\% of Scotland is classified as ‘high’, 25\% as ‘medium’ and 38\% as ‘low/unknown’ sensitivity. The overlap of the mapped species with proposed and existing wind farm developments was assessed and species for which cumulative effects of multiple wind farms are of particular concern identified. Within a Scottish context, bean goose, red kite and hen harrier showed the greatest overlap. Applications and limitations of the approach are discussed.}

    abstract={The concept of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) was proposed in 2013 to improve harmonization of biodiversity data into meaningful metrics. EBVs were conceived as a small set of variables which collectively capture biodiversity change at multiple spatial scales and within time intervals that are of scientific and management interest. Despite the apparent simplicity of the concept, a plethora of variables that describes not only biodiversity but also any environmental features have been proposed as potential EBV (i.e. candidate EBV). The proliferation of candidates reflects a lack of clarity on what may constitute a variable that is essential to track biodiversity change, which hampers the operationalization of EBVs and therefore needs to be urgently addressed. Here, we propose that an EBV should be defined as a biological state variable in three key dimensions (time, space, and biological organization) that is critical to accurately document biodiversity change.},

    abstract = {Summary 1. Animals produce sounds for diverse biological functions such as defending territories, attracting mates, deterring predators, navigation, finding food and maintaining contact with members of their social group. Biologists can take advantage of these acoustic behaviours to gain valuable insights into the spatial and temporal scales over which individuals and populations interact. Advances in bioacoustic technology, including the development of autonomous cabled and wireless recording arrays, permit data collection at multiple locations over time. These systems are transforming the way we study individuals and populations of animals and are leading to significant advances in our understandings of the complex interactions between animals and their habitats. 2. Here, we review questions that can be addressed using bioacoustic approaches, by providing a primer on technologies and approaches used to study animals at multiple organizational levels by ecologists, behaviourists and conservation biologists. 3. Spatially dispersed groups of microphones (arrays) enable users to study signal directionality on a small scale or to locate animals and track their movements on a larger scale. 4. Advances in algorithm development can allow users to discriminate among species, sexes, age groups and individuals. 5. With such technology, users can remotely and non-invasively survey populations, describe the soundscape, quantify anthropogenic noise, study species interactions, gain new insights into the social dynamics of sound-producing animals and track the effects of factors such as climate change and habitat fragmentation on phenology and biodiversity. 6. There remain many challenges in the use of acoustic monitoring, including the difficulties in performing signal recognition across taxa. The bioacoustics community should focus on developing a common framework for signal recognition that allows for various species’ data to be analysed by any recognition system supporting a set of common standards. 7. Synthesis and applications. Microphone arrays are increasingly used to remotely monitor acoustically active animals. We provide examples from a variety of taxa where acoustic arrays have been used for ecological, behavioural and conservation studies. We discuss the technologies used, the methodologies for automating signal recognition and some of the remaining challenges. We also make recommendations for using this technology to aid in wildlife management.},

    abstract = {Invasive species are a leading cause of the current biodiversity decline, and hence examining the major traits favouring invasion is a key and long-standing goal of invasion biology. Despite the prominent role of the advertisement calls in sexual selection and reproduction, very little attention has been paid to the features of acoustic communication of invasive species in nonindigenous habitats and their potential impacts on native species. Here we compare for the first time the transmission efficiency of the advertisement calls of native and invasive species, searching for competitive advantages for acoustic communication and reproduction of introduced taxa, and providing insights into competing hypotheses in evolutionary divergence of acoustic signals: acoustic adaptation vs. morphological constraints. Using sound propagation experiments, we measured the attenuation rates of pure tones (0.2–5 kHz) and playback calls (Lithobates catesbeianus and Pelophylax perezi) across four distances (1, 2, 4, and 8 m) and over two substrates (water and soil) in seven Iberian localities. All factors considered (signal type, distance, substrate, and locality) affected transmission efficiency of acoustic signals, which was maximized with lower frequency sounds, shorter distances, and over water surface. Despite being broadcast in nonindigenous habitats, the advertisement calls of invasive L. catesbeianus were propagated more efficiently than those of the native species, in both aquatic and terrestrial substrates, and in most of the study sites. This implies absence of optimal relationship between native environments and propagation of acoustic signals in anurans, in contrast to what predicted by the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, and it might render these vertebrates particularly vulnerable to intrusion of invasive species producing low frequency signals, such as L. catesbeianus. Our findings suggest that mechanisms optimizing sound transmission in native habitat can play a less significant role than other selective forces or biological constraints in evolutionary design of anuran acoustic signals.},

    abstract = {Abstract Grasslands provide important nesting cover for ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), but they have been largely reduced with intensification of row-cropping systems, resulting in population declines for pheasants and other grassland birds across the U.S. Row-crop intensification and landscape homogenization has had negative impacts on environmental health, and agronomic practices such as fall-seeded cover crops seek to ameliorate some of the environmental issues. Whether fall-seeded cover crops provide additional benefits to wildlife, such as creating nesting cover for pheasants, remains unknown. We used radio telemetry and nest searches in 365, 0.4-ha² plots during summer of 2019 and 2020 in 3 cover types including fall-seeded cover crops, native warm season grasses, and cool season grasses to examine nest site selection by pheasants in the agricultural dominated landscape of Washington County, Iowa. We examined nest site selection at 3 spatial scales based on cover type and specific vegetation attributes to understand factors influencing nest site selection. Highest nest densities were found in native warm season grass (0.59 nests/ha, 95\% CI = 0.41–0.86), while pheasants nested at low densities in cool season grass fields (0.03 nests/ha, 95\% CI = 0.00–0.21) and cover crop fields (0.03 nests/ha, 95\% CI = 0.01–0.12). Most nest-site selection occurred at the landscape level (second order) and patch level (third order) and was influenced by percent litter cover (second order) and visual obstruction or vegetation density (third order). Our findings suggest that cover crops may make minor improvements in nesting cover availability but are unlikely to replicate the needs for nesting cover provided by perennial grasslands in working landscapes and thus have little potential to reverse long-term population declines.},

This guidance exists despite these habitats being among the most biodiverse in boreal Europe and currently under threat due to land conversion. Bats are important bio-indicators of agricultural landscapes, but bat diversity has not explicitly been studied in relation to this policy. We investigate how bat activity, foraging, species richness and functional groups are affected in twenty-six wood-pastures along a gradient of tree density, from open to dense. In parallel, open fields and deciduous forests were sampled and the effect of the surrounding landscape configuration was explored. Our results show a consistent increase in total bat activity, foraging activity and species richness within wood-pastures along the tree density gradient. We find optimal tree densities within wood-pastures are higher than values reported in previous studies, and suggest thresholds might depend on the landscape context. Shrub density was a strong predictor of total bat activity and foraging; whilst structural variation of tree size in wood-pastures was most strongly correlated with species richness. We show that wood-pastures are an important habitat and in comparison to forests they contribute to higher bat species richness and activity levels. Interestingly, higher activity levels of forest feeding specialists were observed in wood-pastures compared to forests. At the landscape level, amount of water in the landscape was the strongest predictor of bat activity whilst deciduous forest mostly influenced foraging activity. This study demonstrates that tree density within wood-pastures is not a limiting factor of bat activity and foraging and that other habitat and landscape parameters are important. Thereby focusing solely on tree density limits will not help to promote the ecological requirements for bats. Instead we suggest that a results based approach to CAP payments would be preferable.}

To better understand human influences on ecosystem, we use diet composition from introduced Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss as indicator of potential changes in the composition of stream-macroinvertebrates due to land use changes from native to exotic vegetation (eucalyptus plantations) in southern Chile. Water quality variables, aquatic macroinvertebrates and Rainbow Trout diet were studied in 12 sites from mountain streams located in two watersheds including one dominated by native riparian vegetation and the other dominated by exotic vegetation. As expected, richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates were clearly higher at sites in native forest than in those with exotic vegetation. Collector-gatherer was the most abundant functional feeding group, but there was no statistical difference in the functional composition between the two watersheds. Differences in in-stream macroinvertebrate availability was more higher correlated with changes in Rainbow Trout diets. Specifically, taxa consumed from the watershed dominated by native forests was higher than from the watershed with exotic vegetation. Additional environmental variables showed statistical differences between watersheds. The exotic vegetation sites had the highest concentrations of dissolved solids, suspended solids, nitrates, chlorides and sulphates. Our findings show that macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and trout diets can be altered by changes in riparian vegetation. The absence of specific macroinvertebrate taxa in streams with exotic vegetation was captured by the composition of trout diets. This suggest that Rainbow Trout diets can be a good biological indicator of land use practices and thus, diet can be used as a rapid and effective tool for evaluate environmental quality. Our findings provide insights about the design of aquatic monitoring programmes to improve detection of anthropogenic impacts in streams in South America and elsewhere.}

We employed a hybrid GEOMOD-Markov Chain model whereby both the spatial allocation and quantity of orchard development were simulated. By 2030, orchard cover is projected to increase by 20\% of its 2015 area, straining limited water resources. To gauge the accuracy of our projection of orchard gain to 2030, we assessed a comparable simulation of orchard gain for 2000–2015 according to the various components the Figure of Merit (FOM) metric. Misses, Hits and False Alarms of simulated orchard gain accounted for 1.84\%, 0.45\% and 0.74\% of the study area respectively over 2000–2015 at a 200-m spatial resolution, for which the FOM was appreciable (15\%) given the limited extent of simulated orchard gain and actual orchard cover across the study region (1.2\% and 5.3\%). With respect to orchard gain, spatial allocation error was more than land-change quantity error at 200-m resolution, at 1.48\% and 1.10\% of the study area, respectively. Predicting the location of agricultural change remains a priority and challenge for model utility, given scant agricultural footprints in semi-arid regions and their large draw on limited water resources. Results also indicate the importance of incorporating dynamic water availability and demand over the course of agricultural expansion, including shifts in the location preference amongst farmers. The integration of dynamic, agent-based models within our GEOMOD-Markov Chain framework is therefore methodologically appealing, but would adversely increase complexity for policymakers.}

abstract = {Abstract Many bee species are declining globally, but to detect trends and monitor bee assemblages, robust sampling methods are required. Numerous sampling methods are used, but a critical review of their relative effectiveness is lacking. Moreover, evidence suggests the relative effectiveness of sampling methods depends on habitat, yet efficacy in urban areas has yet to be evaluated. This study compared the bee community documented using observational records, targeted netting, mobile gardens, pan traps (blue and yellow), vane traps (blue and yellow), and trap-nests. The comparative surveys of native bees and honeybees were undertaken in an urbanized region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hot spot. The outcomes of the study were then compared to a synthesis based on a comprehensive literature review of studies where two or more bee sampling methods were conducted. Observational records far exceeded all other methods in terms of abundance of bees recorded, but were unable to distinguish finer taxonomic levels. Of methods that captured individuals, thereby permitting taxonomic identification, targeted sweep netting vastly outperformed the passive sampling methods, yielding a total of 1324 individuals, representing 131 taxonomic units—even when deployed over a shorter duration. The relative effectiveness of each method differed according to taxon. From the analysis of the literature, there was high variability in relative effectiveness of methods, but targeted sweep netting and blue vane traps tended to be most effective, in accordance with results from this study. However, results from the present study differed from most previous studies in the extremely low catch rates in pan traps. Species using trap-nests represented only a subset of all potential cavity-nesters, and their relative abundances in the trap-nests differed from those in the field. Mobile gardens were relatively ineffective at attracting bees. For urbanized habitat within this biodiversity hot spot, targeted sweep netting is indispensable for obtaining a comprehensive indication of native bee assemblages; passive sampling methods alone recorded only a small fraction of the native bee community. Overall, a combination of methods should be used for sampling bee communities, as each has their own biases, and certain taxa were well represented in some methods, but poorly represented in others.},

Insect abundance increased with time of day, temperature, and June date, but decreased with wind resulting in a reduction by 54\%. The abundance of insects killed on a car windscreen was strongly positively correlated with the abundance of insects caught in sweep nets and on sticky plates in the same study areas and at the same time as when insects were sampled using windscreens. The decline in abundance of insects on windscreens predicted the rate at which barn swallows Hirundo rustica fed their nestlings, even when controlling statistically for time of day, weather, and age and number of nestlings. The abundance of breeding pairs of three species of aerially insectivorous birds was positively correlated with the abundance of insects killed on windscreens at the same time in the same study area. This suggests a link between two trophic levels as affected by the temporal reduction in the abundance of flying insects. These findings are consistent with recent dramatic declines in insect abundance in Europe and North America with consequences for the rate of food provisioning of barn swallow offspring, the abundance of aerially insectivorous birds and bottom-up trophic cascades.},

  abstract = "The inferences that can be made from any study are limited by the
              quality of the sampling design. By bad luck, when monitoring
              species that are difficult to detect (cryptic), sampling designs
              become dictated by what is feasible rather than what is desired.
              We calibrated and conducted a cost-benefit analysis of four
              acoustic recorder options that were being considered as potential
              solutions to several sampling restrictions experienced while
              monitoring the Australasian bittern, a cryptic wetland bird. Such
              sampling restrictions are commonly experienced while monitoring
              many different endangered species, particularly those that are
              cryptic. The recorder options included mono and stereo devices,
              with two sound file processing options (visual and audible
              analysis). Recording devices provided call-count data similar to
              those collected by field observers but at a fraction of the cost,
              which meant that ``idealistic'' sampling regimes, previously
              thought to be too expensive, became feasible for bitterns. Our
              study is one of the few to assess the monetary value of recording
              devices in the context of data quality, allowing trade-offs (and
              potential solutions) commonly experienced while monitoring
              cryptic endangered species to be shown and compared more clearly.
              The ability to overcome challenges of monitoring cryptic species
              in this way increases research possibilities for data deficient
              species and is applicable to any species with similar monitoring

    ABSTRACT = {Global warming is deeply influencing various ecological processes, especially regarding the phenological synchronization pattern between species, but more cases around the world are needed to reveal it. We report how the forest leaf phenology and ungulate molting respond differently to climate change, and investigate whether it will result in a potential phenology mismatch. Here, we explored how climate change might alter phenological synchronization between forest leaf phenology and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) molting in northeast China based on a camera-trapping dataset of seven consecutive years, analyzing forest leaf phenology in combination with records of Siberian roe deer molting over the same period by means of wavelet analysis. We found that the start of the growing season of forest leaf phenology was advanced, while the end of the growing season was delayed, so that the length of the growing season was prolonged. Meanwhile, the start and the end of the molting of Siberian roe deer were both advanced in spring, but in autumn, the start of molting was delayed while the end of molting was advanced. The results of wavelet analysis also suggested the time lag of synchronization fluctuated slightly from year to year between forest leaf phenology and Siberian roe deer molting, with a potential phenology mismatch in spring, indicating the effect of global warming on SRD to forest leaf phenology. Overall, our study provides new insight into the synchronization between forest leaf phenology and ungulate molting, and demonstrates feasible approaches to data collection and analysis using camera-trapping data to explore global warming issues.},

DNA barcoding is well established in animals, but there is not yet any universally accepted barcode for plants. Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two biodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using \&gt;1,600 samples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous plant studies, we assessed to what extent a “DNA barcoding gap” is present between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple accessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy amplification, and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK gene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we further demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity inventories. In addition, analyzing \&gt;1,000 species of Mesoamerican orchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and proves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes.}

    abstract = {Abstract Movement ecology of small wild animals is often reliant on radio-tracking methods due to the size and weight restrictions of available transmitters. In manual radio telemetry, large errors in spatial position and infrequent relocations prevent the effective analysis of small-scale movement patterns and dynamic aspects of habitat selection. Automatic radio-tracking systems present a potential solution for overcoming these drawbacks. However, existing systems use customized electronics and commercial software or exclusively record presence/absence data instead of triangulating the position of tagged individuals. We present a low-cost automatic radio-tracking system built from consumer electronic devices that can locate the position of radio transmitters under field conditions. We provide information on the hardware components, describe mobile and stationary set-up options, and offer open-source software solutions. We describe the workflow from hardware setup and antenna calibration, to recording and processing the data and present a proof of concept for forest-dwelling bats using a mixed forest as study area. With an average bearing error of 6.8° and a linear error of 21 m within a distance ranging from 65 m to 190 m, the accuracy of our system exceeds that of both traditional methods as well as manual telemetry. This affordable and easy-to-use automatic radio-tracking system complements existing tools in movement ecology research by combining the advantages of lightweight and cost-efficient radio telemetry with an automatic tracking set-up.},

In this work, we apply HMMs to several different species and bioacoustic tasks using generalized spectral features that can be easily adjusted across species and HMM network topologies suited to each task. This experimental work includes a simple call type classification task using one HMM per vocalization for repertoire analysis of Asian elephants, a language-constrained song recognition task using syllable models as base units for ortolan bunting vocalizations, and a stress stimulus differentiation task in poultry vocalizations using a non-sequential model via a one-state HMM with Gaussian mixtures. Results show strong performance across all tasks and illustrate the flexibility of the HMM framework for a variety of species, vocalization types, and analysis tasks.},

A “hot spot” of intense desalination activity has always been the Arabian Gulf, but other regional centers of activity emerge and become more prominent, such as the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, or the coastal waters of California, China and Australia. Despite the many benefits the technology has to offer, concerns rise over potential negative impacts on the environment. Key issues are the concentrate and chemical discharges to the marine environment, the emissions of air pollutants and the energy demand of the processes. To safeguard a sustainable use of desalination technology, the impacts of each major desalination project should be investigated and mitigated by means of a project- and location-specific environmental impact assessment (EIA) study, while the benefits and impacts of different water supply options should be balanced on the scale of regional management plans. In this context, our paper intends to present an overview on present seawater desalination capacities by region, a synopsis of the key environmental concerns of desalination, including ways of mitigating the impacts of desalination on the environment, and of avoiding some of the dangers of the environment to desalination.}

ABSTRACT = {The field of bioacoustics is rapidly developing and characterized by diverse methodologies, approaches and aims. For instance, bioacoustics encompasses studies on the perception of pure tones in meticulously controlled laboratory settings, documentation of species’ presence and activities using recordings from the field, and analyses of circadian calling patterns in animal choruses. Newcomers to the field are confronted with a vast and fragmented literature, and a lack of accessible reference papers or textbooks. In this paper we contribute towards filling this gap. Instead of a classical list of “dos” and “don’ts”, we review some key papers which, we believe, embody best practices in several bioacoustic subfields. In the first three case studies, we discuss how bioacoustics can help identify the ‘who’, ‘where’ and ‘how many’ of animals within a given ecosystem. Specifically, we review cases in which bioacoustic methods have been applied with success to draw inferences regarding species identification, population structure, and biodiversity. In fourth and fifth case studies, we highlight how structural properties in signal evolution can emerge via ecological constraints or cultural transmission. Finally, in a sixth example, we discuss acoustic methods that have been used to infer predator–prey dynamics in cases where direct observation was not feasible. Across all these examples, we emphasize the importance of appropriate recording parameters and experimental design. We conclude by highlighting common best practices across studies as well as caveats about our own overview. We hope our efforts spur a more general effort in standardizing best practices across the subareas we’ve highlighted in order to increase compatibility among bioacoustic studies and inspire cross-pollination across the discipline.},

abstract = {Abstract The management of animal endangered species requires detailed information on their distribution and abundance, which is often hard to obtain. When animals communicate using sounds, one option is to use automatic sound recorders to gather information on the species for long periods of time with low effort. One drawback of this method is that processing all the information manually requires large amounts of time and effort. Our objective was to create a relatively “user-friendly” (i.e., that does not require big programming skills) automatic detection algorithm to improve our ability to get basic data from sound-emitting animal species. We illustrate our algorithm by showing two possible applications with the Hawai'i ‘Amakihi, Hemignathus virens virens, a forest bird from the island of Hawai'i. We first characterized the ‘Amakihi song using recordings from areas where the species is present in high densities. We used this information to train a classification algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), in order to identify ‘Amakihi songs from a series of potential songs. We then used our algorithm to detect the species in areas where its presence had not been previously confirmed. We also used the algorithm to compare the relative abundance of the species in different areas where management actions may be applied. The SVM had an accuracy of 86.5\% in identifying ‘Amakihi. We confirmed the presence of the ‘Amakihi at the study area using the algorithm. We also found that the relative abundance of ‘Amakihi changes among study areas, and this information can be used to assess where management strategies for the species should be better implemented. Our automatic song detection algorithm is effective, “user-friendly” and can be very useful for optimizing the management and conservation of those endangered animal species that communicate acoustically.},

abstract = {Birdsongs are highly valuable for bird studies as they provide insights into various aspects such as species distribution, population structures, and habitat. Recognizing birdsongs plays a crucial role in bird conservation efforts. However, manually collecting a large number of birdsongs from the natural environment is expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, using limited birdsong data often results in low classification accuracy of the models. To better identification of birdsongs, we utilize wavelet transform(WT) to convert them into spectrograms, which contain abundant energy and frequency information. Effectively extracting these features is vital to improve the classification accuracy of the model. To address this problem, we proposed an improved ACGAN model based on residual structure and attention mechanism named DR-ACGAN, which achieved stable training of the model and high-quality generated birdsong spectrograms. The dynamic convolution kernel is then fused with MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and VGG16 models and trained on different datasets, which used different ways of mixing the generated and original spectrograms. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy after data augmentation improves by 6.66\%, 4.35\%, and 2.29\% compared to the original dataset in the three base classifiers. After adding dynamic convolutional kernel structure, the accuracy is further improved by 1.68\%, 0.67\%, and 0.38\% on average which the VGG16 model achieves the highest accuracy of 97.60\%.}
