This literature review aims to investigate acoustic monitoring methods, with a focus on those applied on wind farm sites. Four specific research questions were addressed:

(I)    What are the strengths and weaknesses of bioacoustics methods compared with traditional (manual) species monitoring methodologies?
(II)   What signal processing tools and methods are used to analyse bioacoustic data? What are the particular challenges of PAM at wind farm sites?
(III)  How do the diversity, use and classification accuracy of automatic monitoring methods compare? 
(IV)   What gaps and challenges exist and what future research is needed for passive acoustic monitoring?

We conclude with recommendations to (onshore) wind farm managers for productive application to their sites.
